# Spatial Data

* [Ontario Hydro Network (OHN) - Watercourse](https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/a222f2996e7c454f9e8d028aa05995d3_26/about) provides the location of watercourses in Ontario and is offered by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.
* Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry [Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System (SOLRIS) Version 3](https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/documents/lio::southern-ontario-land-resource-information-system-solris-3-0/about), April 2019
* Ontario Geological Survey [surficial geology of southern Ontario, 2010](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/surficial-geology-of-southern-ontario).
* Ground surface elevations were collected from the 2006 version of the [Provincial (Ministry of Natural Resources) Digital Elevation Model (DEM)](https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/maps/mnrf::provincial-digital-elevation-model-pdem/about). This is a 10x10m² DEM derived from 1:10,000 scale OBM base mapping based on photogrammetic elevation points and 5m contours where the photogrammetic elevation points did not exist.


# Timeseries Data (Climate and Surface Water)

## Web Data Scrapers

On a nightly basis, scheduled tasks are used to automatically download and insert new data into the [ORMGP database](https://owrc.github.io/database-manual/Contents/TOC.html), a process called ["web scraping"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping). So, in addition to hydrogeologic information, the database maintains a realtime hydrometeorological dataset at the **daily** time scale. This means that, for the most part, information scraped below does not enter the database as it is of a sub-daily resolution. Rather, the higher-resolution data, including the gridded data, are maintained running [Delft-FEWS](https://oss.deltares.nl/web/delft-fews/about-delft-fews) on a dedicated server.

The objective is to maintain a **daily** hydrometeorological dataset spatially distributed over the 30,000km² ORMGP management area, going back at least a century.  Data collected are "near" realtime in that they are what is reported when the scheduled task was run (the night prior). Many of the web tools maintained and numerical models that are archived depend on this dataset.


### Current data sources

Below is a list data sources used in deriving many of the interpolation products. These sources are all free and open, but come in a variety of formats.


* **WSC** - Water Survey of Canada 
  - [MSC Datamart](https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-datamart/readme_en/) *.csv file server for near real-time data
    - daily streamflow stage and discharge
  - [National Water Data Archive: HYDAT](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/monitoring/survey/data-products-services/national-archive-hydat.html) are updated quarterly as sqlite database files. Imports from HYDAT always overwrites data recorded through Datamart.
    - daily streamflow stage and discharge

* **ECCC-MSC** - Environment and Climate Change Canada—Meteorological Service of Canada
    - [Historical Data](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html) (html portal to meteorologic data)
        - hourly: air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction
        - daily: min/max air temperature, rainfall, snowfall, snow depth
    - Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA)
        - [Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (CaPA-RDPA)](https://weather.gc.ca/grib/grib2_RDPA_ps10km_e.html) is a gridded (~10km) 6-hourly near realtime continuous precipitation field for the past 20 years, albeit in many overlapping versions.
        - [High Resolution Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (CaPA-HRDPA)](https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-data/nwp_hrdpa/readme_hrdpa_en/) is a refined version (~2.5km) of the product above, going back to 2019.

* **NOAA-NSIDC** - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Snow & Ice Data Center
    * [Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS)](https://nsidc.org/data/g02158)
        - continuous ~30m resolution grid 24-hour accumulations of snowmelt and mean daily snow water equivalent (SWE), realtime from 2009 (when coverage was opened to Canada)


## Partners' data

A number of our partners maintain internal databases. Attempts are being made to integrate these sources to our workflow without the need for data duplication through API setup on the partners' end. This work is in progress, to date API linkages have been made to the following agencies:

* TRCA
* CVC
* CLOCA
* York Region
