There are a number of potential improvments that can be attained. This section lists certain improvements that will be considered for future iterations of the water budget tool. (The current version is 1.0.)

1. attain and compile any number of local net radiometer stations to derive the empirical coefficients use to determine net radiation 
1. utilize Environment Canada's hourly wind speeds, relative humidity, pressure, visibility, etc. to derrive better estimates of potential evaporation.
